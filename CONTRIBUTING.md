# Contributing to Tapak

This document describes the process of contributing to Tapak. It is intended for anyone considering creating an issue,
discussion, or pull request.

The easiest way to contribute is to share feedback.

We discuss bugs, features, and design decisions via our [discussions](https://github.com/syaiful6/tapak/discussions).
If you don't find a previous discussion on your topic, feel free to start a new one.

We use [issue tracker](https://github.com/syaiful6/tapak/issues) for actionable items, don't use the issue tracker
for discussion or feature request. Instead, we use Github [discussion](https://github.com/syaiful6/tapak/discussions)
for that.

## Quick Guide

### I've implemented a fix or feature

Whenever possible, please open a discussion first to get feedback on your proposed changes. But submitting a pull request
are always welcome.

### I have a bug report

Search the issue tracker and discussions to see if the issue has already been reported.

If your issue hasn't been reported, open an [Issue Triage](https://github.com/syaiful6/tapak/discussions/new?category=issue-triage)
discussion. We don't have template for bug reports yet, but please be as detailed as possible.

### I have a feature requests and ideas

Like bug reports, search the issue tracker and discussions to see if the feature has already been requested. Otherwise, open
a dicussion in the [Feature requests, Ideas](https://github.com/syaiful6/tapak/discussions/new?category=feature-requests-ideas)
category.

### Other discussions

Open a new discussion in the appropriate category.
